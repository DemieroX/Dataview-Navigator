# Dataview-Navigator
A data note navigator for Obsidian using DataviewJS

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c0bc521-99ff-4faa-97b3-cea3081b7b1b)

*The main navigator requires the **"Dataview"** plugin!*
*New resource creator requires the **"Templater"** and **"Meta-Bind"** plugins!*

This is a navigation code-block I created for personal-use in my Obsidian vault.
It allows users to navigate saved website & videos in a pretty navigator format.
I was not planning to share this, but many people have shown interest so here it is.
I do not promise clean code, only one that works :D

## Installation
- Drag **Dataview Navigator.md** to your Obsidian vault folder.
- In the code, specify the resource directory
- Toggle ligt-dark mode (Optional)

### Optional Install (New Resource Creator Button)
I have also created a Metabind button that creates a new resource note from a template.
You can add this to your project if you don't want to setup your own template from scratch.

- Add **"New Resource Button - MetaBind"** and **"New Resource.md"** to your Obsidian vault folder.
- Write the new paths for the existing template & created note in the Metabind's code.

## Recommendations
- While light mode works, I still recommend dark mode with this navigator
- Create a new folder for your resources, so it doesn't fill up unwanted space in your vault.
