# Dataview-Navigator
A data note navigator for Obsidian using DataviewJS

This is a navigation code-block I created for personal-use in my Obsidian vault.
It allows users to navigate saved website & videos in a pretty navigator format.
*The main navigator requires the **"Dataview"** plugin!*
*New resource creator requires the **"Templater"** and **"Meta-Bind"** plugins!*

## Installation
- Drag **Dataview Navigator.md** to your Obsidian vault folder.
- In the code, specify the resource directory
- Toggle ligt-dark mode (Optional)

### Optional Install (New Resource Creator Button)
I have also created a Metabind button that creates a new resource note from a template.
You can add this to your project if you don't want to setup your own template from scratch.

- Add **"New Resource Button - MetaBind"** and **"New Resource.md"** to your Obsidian vault folder.
- Write the new paths for the existing template & created note in the Metabind's code.
